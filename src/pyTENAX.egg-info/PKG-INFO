PyTENAX
=================

PyTENAX contains a set of methods to apply the Non-Asymptotic statistical model for eXtreme
return levels (TENAX).

pyTENAX repository also includes SMEV class (Simplified Metastatistical Extreme Value)

Installation
------------
Install using:

Python version required: <3.12

Module required can be found in either requirements.txt or env.yml

For the moment the package is not available on pypi, so you need to install it from the source code.
To do so, clone the repository and run the following command in the root folder of the repository:

.. code-block:: bash
    
   pip install .

Usage
-----
!! TO COMPLETE !!

The class contains the following methods:

!! TO COMPLETE !!

The following is an example of how to use the class:

.. code-block:: python

    #TODO



For a complete example of how to use the class, run the file `test_tenax.py` in the `src` folder with the following command:

.. code-block:: python

    python src/test_smev.py



Development
-----------
Please work on a feature branch and create a pull request to the development 
branch. If necessary to merge manually do so without fast forward:

.. code-block:: bash

    git merge --no-ff myfeature

To build a development environment run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv env 
    source env/bin/activate 
    pip install -e .
    pip install -r requirements.txt

With Conda 

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f env.yml
    conda activate env
    pip install -e .


Rebuild is done by setup.py inside of new branch.
.. code-block::
    setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
